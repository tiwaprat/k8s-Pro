ABOUT PROJECT: This project outlines all the steps to create a basic kubernetes cluster with infrastructure on AWS EC2 Instances. We will also run a spring boot application (Enhanced Student app) on this cluster to verify setup. 

ABOUT APPLICATION: The Enhanced student App a.k.a "esa" application is at /infra/EnrichedStudentApp/ folder it is a sprint boot based application. On access application shows a single html page which can record student information and can show on the same page. We can create and delere the records.
                   in mysql database.  

ABOUT INFRA: We would be provisioning total 4 EC2 Instances. 
             1. for controlplan components.   
             2. Building docker images and pushing them into dockerhub (buildserver)
             3. 2 workernodes one for myesa application image and another for mysql image
             
Steps to Follow:
1. Fork git repo https://github.com/tiwaprat/k8s-Pro.git
2. Prepare docker image : 
   * Provision a ubuntu based ec2 instance
   * sudo hostnamectl set buildserver
   * sudo apt update
   * sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk maven  -y 
   * sudo apt install docker.io -y 
   * git clone https://github.com/tiwaprat/k8s-Pro.git
   * mkdir EnrichedStudentApp
   * mv -r /k8s-Pro/infra/EnrichedStudentApp .
